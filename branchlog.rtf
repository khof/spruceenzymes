A. The Apple software, tools, utilities, sample or example code, documentation, interfaces, content, data, and other materials accompanying this License, whether on disk, print or electronic documentation, in read only memory, or any other media or in any other form, (collectively, the "Developer Software") are licensed, not sold, to you by Apple Inc. ("Apple") for use only under the terms of this License.  Apple and/or Apple\'92s licensors retain ownership of the Developer Software itself and reserve all rights not expressly granted to you. The terms of this License will govern any software upgrades provided by Apple that replace and/or supplement the original Developer Software, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that license will govern. \
\
B. Title and intellectual property rights in and to any content displayed by or accessed through the Developer Software belongs to the respective content owner. Such content may be protected by copyright or other intellectual property laws and treaties, and may be subject to terms of use of the third party providing such content. This License does not grant you any rights to use such content nor does it guarantee that such content will continue to be available to you.\
\
2. Permitted License Uses and Restrictions.\
A. License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, you are granted a limited, non-exclusive license to use the Developer Software on Apple-branded computers to develop and test application and other software. You may make only as many internal use copies of the Developer Software as reasonably necessary to use the Developer Software as permitted under this License and distribute such copies only to your employees whose job duties require them to so use the Developer Software; provided that you reproduce on each copy of the Developer Software or portion thereof, all copyright or other proprietary notices contained on the original. \
\
B. Other Use Restrictions. The grants set forth in this License do not permit you to, and you agree not to, install, use or run the Developer Software on any non-Apple-branded computer, or to enable others to do so. Except as otherwise expressly permitted by the terms of this License or as otherwise licensed by Apple: (i) only one user may use the Developer Software at a time, and (ii) you may not make the Developer Software available over a network where it could be run or used by multiple computers at the same time. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, sublicense or otherwise redistribute the Developer Software or exploit any services provided by or through the Developer Software in any unauthorized way. \
\
C. No Reverse Engineering; Limitations. You may not, and you agree not to or to enable others to, copy (except as expressly permitted by this License), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, decrypt, modify, create derivative works of the Developer Software or any services provided by or through the Developer Software or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by licensing terms governing use of the  Open-Sourced Components or Sample Code). \

\
F. Use of System-Provided Images. The system-provided images owned by Apple and documented as such in Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for OS X and iOS ("System-Provided Images") are licensed to you solely for the purpose of developing OS X and iOS applications, respectively, using the Developer Software. Upon termination of this License, you may continue to distribute the System-Provided Images as used within software you developed using the Developer Software; however, you agree to provide to Apple, at Apple's request, a copy of any software you developed using the Developer Software that incorporates any of the System-Provided Images so Apple may determine, in its sole discretion, whether your use of the System-Provided Images complies with these terms.\
\
G. Location Services; Consents. \
1. Apple may enable you to access certain location-based application programming interfaces (APIs) (e.g., Core Location) documented by Apple (\'93Location APIs\'94) through the Developer Software.  Subject to these terms and conditions, you may use such APIs and services only to enable software programs you develop for use on OS X (\'93Applications\'94) to access location data (e.g. the real-time geographic location of a user\'92s computer) from users who consent to such access. For Applications that use Location APIs or otherwise provide location-based services, you agree that such Applications may not be designed or marketed for automatic or autonomous control of vehicle behavior, or for emergency or life-saving purposes. In addition, Applications that offer location-based services or functionality must notify and obtain consent from an individual before his or her location data is collected, transmitted or otherwise used by the Application. For Applications that use Location APIs for real-time navigation (including, but not limited to, turn-by-turn route guidance and other routing that is enabled through the use of a sensor), you must have an end-user license agreement that includes the following notice: YOUR USE OF THIS REAL TIME ROUTE GUIDANCE APPLICATION IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. LOCATION DATA MAY NOT BE ACCURATE.\
\
2. You agree that neither you nor your Applications will disable, override or otherwise interfere with any Apple-implemented system alerts, warnings, display panels, consent panels and the like, including, but not limited to, those that are intended to notify the user that the user's location data is being collected, transmitted, maintained, processed or used, or intended to obtain consent for such use.  If consent is denied or withdrawn, neither you nor your Applications may collect, transmit, maintain, process or utilize the user's location information or data through the Location APIs. You understand and agree that you and your Applications must comply with all applicable criminal, civil and statutory laws and regulations (including privacy, data collection and location service laws and regulations) in any jurisdictions in which your Applications may be delivered.  You shall be solely responsible for, and Apple shall have no responsibility or liability whatsoever with respect to, any and all claims, suits, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses arising from, related or attributable to, or otherwise involving your Application, including but not limited to your Application\'92s use of the Location APIs.\
\
H. Compliance with Laws. You agree to use the Developer Software and the services in compliance with all applicable laws, including local laws of the country or region in which you reside or in which you download or use the Developer Software or services.\
\
3. Transfer. You may make a one-time permanent transfer of all of your license rights to the Developer Software (in its original form as provided by Apple) to another party, provided that: (a) the transfer must include all of the Developer Software, including all its component parts and this License; (b) you do not retain any copies of the Developer Software, full or partial, including copies stored on a computer or other storage device; and (c) the party receiving the Developer Software accepts the terms and conditions of this License. You may not transfer any Developer Software that has been modified or replaced under Section 13 below. All components of the Developer Software are provided as part of a bundle and may not be separated from the bundle and distributed as standalone applications.\
\
4. Consent to Use of Data.\
A. Diagnostic and Usage Data. If you choose to allow diagnostic and usage collection, you agree that Apple and its subsidiaries and agents may collect, maintain, process and use diagnostic, technical, usage and related information, including but not limited to unique system or hardware identifiers, information about your computer, system and application software, and peripherals, that is gathered periodically to provide and improve Apple\'92s products and services, facilitate the provision of software updates, product support and other services to you (if any) related to the Developer Software, and to verify compliance with the terms of this License. You may change your preferences for Diagnostics & Usage collection at any time by going to the Diagnostics & Usage setting on your computer and deselecting the checkbox. The Diagnostics & Usage setting is found in the Security & Privacy pane within System Preferences. Apple may use this information, as long as it is collected in a form that does not personally identify you, for the purposes described above. To enable Apple\'92s partners and third party developers to improve their software, hardware and services designed for use with Apple products, Apple may also provide any such partner or third party developer with a subset of diagnostic information that is relevant to that partner\'92s or developer\'92s software, hardware and/or services, as long as the diagnostic information is in a form that does not personally identify you. \
\
B. Privacy Policy. At all times your information will be treated in accordance with Apple\'92s Privacy Policy, which is incorporated by reference into this License and can be viewed at: http://www.apple.com/privacy/.\
\
5. Services; Mac Developer Program.\
A. Apple may provide access to services by or through the Developer Software for you to use.  Use of these services may require an Apple ID, may require you to accept additional terms and may be subject to additional fees.

You agree that the services contain proprietary content, information and material that is owned by Apple and its licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, and that you will not use such proprietary content, information or materials in any way whatsoever except for permitted use of the services or in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this License or that infringes any intellectual property rights of a third party or Apple. Except to the extent expressly permitted in the applicable terms for the services, You agree not to reproduce, modify, rent, lease, lend, sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit the services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, using the services to transmit any malware, or by trespass or burdening network capacity. \
\
C. In addition, services that may be accessed, linked to or displayed by or through the Developer Software may not be available in all languages or in all countries. Apple makes no representation that any such services would be appropriate or available for use in any particular location. Apple reserves the right to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to any services at any time. In no event will Apple be liable for the removal of or disabling of access to any such services or for any updates, maintenance, warranty, technical or other support for such services.

Any attempt to do so is a violation of the rights of Apple and its licensors of the SDK or services provided by the SDK. If You breach any of the foregoing restrictions, You may be subject to prosecution and damages. All licenses not expressly granted in this Agreement are reserved and no other licenses, immunity or rights, express or implied are granted by Apple, by implication, estoppel, or otherwise. This Agreement does not grant You any rights to use any trademarks, logos or service marks belonging to Apple, including but not limited to the iPhone or iPod word marks. If You make reference to any Apple products or technology or use Apple\'92s trademarks, You agree to comply with the published guidelines at http://www.apple.com/legal/trademark/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html, as modified by Apple from time to time.\
\
2.6     Updates; No Support or Maintenance\
Apple may extend, enhance, or otherwise modify the SDK at any time without notice, but Apple shall not be obligated to provide You with any Updates to the SDK. If Updates are made available by Apple, the terms of this Agreement will govern such Updates, unless the Update is accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that license will govern. Apple is not obligated to provide any maintenance, technical or other support for the SDK. You acknowledge that Apple has no express or implied obligation to announce or make available any Updates of the SDK to anyone in the future. Should an Update be made available, it may have APIs, features, services or functionality that are different from those found in the SDK licensed hereunder.\
\
3.              Your Obligations\
3.1             General\
You certify to Apple and agree that:\
(a) You are of the legal age of majority in the jurisdiction in which You reside (at least 18 years of age in many countries) and have the right and authority to enter into this Agreement on Your own behalf, or if You are entering into this Agreement on behalf of Your company, organization, educational institution, or agency, instrumentality, or department of the federal government, that You have the right and authority to legally bind such entity or organization to the terms and obligations of this Agreement;     \
(b) All information provided to Apple by You will be current, true, accurate, supportable and complete;\
(c) You will comply with the terms of and fulfill Your obligations under this Agreement and You agree to monitor and be responsible for Your Authorized Users\'92 use of the SDK and their compliance with the terms of this Agreement; and\
(d) You will be solely responsible for all costs, expenses, losses and liabilities incurred, and activities undertaken by You and Authorized Users in connection with the SDK, Your Applications and Your related development efforts.\
\
3.2     Use of the SDK\
As a condition to using the SDK, You agree that:\
(a) You will only use the SDK for the purposes and in the manner expressly permitted by this Agreement and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations;\
(b) You will not use the SDK for any unlawful or illegal activity, nor to develop any Application which would commit or facilitate the commission of a crime, or other tortious, unlawful, or illegal act;\
(c) You will not install or use Applications developed hereunder on any iOS Products or on any other hardware or device, except on Apple-branded computers as expressly permitted in Section 2.2(a);\
(d) You will not distribute Applications created with the SDK absent a separate agreement with Apple;\
(e) To the best of Your knowledge and belief, Your Application does not and will not violate, misappropriate, or infringe any Apple or third party copyrights, trademarks, rights of privacy and publicity, trade secrets, patents, or other proprietary or legal rights (e.g. musical composition or performance rights, video rights, photography or image rights, logo rights, third party data rights, etc. for content and materials that may be included in Your Application); and\
(f) You will not, through use of the SDK or otherwise, create any Application or other program that would disable, hack or otherwise interfere with any security, digital signing, digital rights management, content protection, verification or authentication mechanisms implemented in or by the iOS operating system software, this SDK, or other Apple software, services or technology, or enable others to do so.\
\
4.      Confidentiality\
4.1             Information Deemed Apple Confidential\
You agree that all pre-release versions of the SDK (including pre-release Documentation) will be deemed \'93Apple Confidential Information\'94; provided however that upon the commercial release of the SDK the terms and conditions that disclose pre-release features of the SDK will no longer be confidential. Other non-public information disclosed by Apple to You in connection with this Agreement will be deemed Apple Confidential Information under this Agreement only if it is identified or marked as "Confidential" if disclosed in writing, or is designated as being confidential at the time of disclosure, if disclosed orally or visually. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Apple Confidential Information will not include: (i)\'a0information that is generally and legitimately available to the public through no fault or breach of Yours, (ii) information that is generally made available to the public by Apple, (iii)\'a0information that is independently developed by You without the use of any Apple Confidential Information, (iv)\'a0information that was rightfully obtained from a third party who had the right to transfer or disclose it to You without limitation, or (v) any FOSS included in the SDK and accompanied by licensing terms that do not impose confidentiality obligations on the use or disclosure of such FOSS.\
\
4.2             Obligations Regarding Apple Confidential Information\
You agree to protect Apple Confidential Information using at least the same degree of care that You use to protect Your own confidential information of similar importance, but no less than a reasonable degree of care. You agree to use Apple Confidential Information solely for the purpose of exercising Your rights and performing Your obligations under this Agreement and agree not to use Apple Confidential Information for any other purpose, for Your own or any third party\'92s benefit, without Apple's prior written consent. You further agree not to disclose or disseminate Apple Confidential Information to anyone other than: (i) those of Your employees and contractors, or those of Your faculty and staff if You are an educational institution, who have a need to know and who are bound by a written agreement that prohibits unauthorized use or disclosure of the Apple Confidential Information; or (ii) except as otherwise agreed or permitted in writing by Apple. You may disclose Apple Confidential Information to the extent required by law, provided that You take reasonable steps to notify Apple of such requirement before disclosing the Apple Confidential Information and to obtain protective treatment of the Apple Confidential Information. You acknowledge that damages for improper disclosure of Apple Confidential Information may be irreparable; therefore, Apple is entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction and preliminary injunction, in addition to all other remedies.\
\
4.3     Information Submitted to Apple Not Deemed Confidential\
Apple works with many application and software developers and some of their products may be similar to or compete with Your Applications. Apple may also be developing its own similar or competing applications and products or may decide to do so in the future. To avoid potential misunderstandings, Apple cannot agree, and expressly disclaims, any confidentiality obligations or use restrictions, express or implied, with respect to any information that You may provide in connection with this Agreement, including information about Your Application (such disclosures will be referred to as \'93Licensee Disclosures\'94). You agree that any such Licensee Disclosures will be non-confidential. Apple will be free to use and disclose any Licensee Disclosures on an unrestricted basis without notifying or compensating You. You release Apple from all liability and obligations that may arise from the receipt, review, use, or disclosure of any portion of any Licensee Disclosures. Any physical materials You submit to Apple will become Apple property and Apple will have no obligation to return those materials to You or to certify their destruction.\
\
4.4     Press Releases and Other Publicity\
You may not issue any press releases or make any other public statements regarding this Agreement, its terms and conditions, or the relationship of the parties without Apple\'92s express prior written approval, which may be withheld at Apple's discretion.\
\
5.      Indemnification \
To the extent permitted by applicable law, You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Apple, its directors, officers, employees, independent contractors and agents (each an "Apple Indemnified Party") from any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, expenses and costs (including without limitation attorneys' fees and court costs) (collectively "Losses") incurred by an Apple Indemnified Party as a result of Your breach of this Agreement, a breach of any certification, covenant, representation or warranty made by You in this Agreement, any claims that Your Applications violate or infringe any third party intellectual property or proprietary rights, or otherwise related to or arising from Your use of the SDK, Your Application(s) or Your development of Applications.\
\
You acknowledge that the SDK is not intended for use in the development of Applications in which errors or inaccuracies in the content, functionality, services, data or information provided by the Application or the failure of the Application could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage, and, to the extent permitted by law, You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Apple Indemnified Party from any Losses incurred by such Apple Indemnified Party by reason of any such use.  In no event may You enter into any settlement or like agreement with a third party that affects Apple's rights or binds Apple in any way, without the prior written consent of Apple.\
\
6.              Term and Termination\
6.1     Term  \
The license to use this version of the SDK is effective until terminated in accordance with Section 6.2.\
\
6.2     Termination\
This Agreement and all rights under this Agreement will terminate automatically or cease to be effective without notice from Apple if You or any of Your Authorized Users fail to comply with any term(s) of this Agreement. In addition, Apple reserves the right to terminate this Agreement if a new version of Apple\'92s iOS operating system software or the SDK is released which is incompatible with this version of the SDK.  Either party may terminate this Agreement for its convenience, for any reason or no reason, effective 30 days after providing the other party with written notice of its intent to terminate.\
\
6.3     Effect of Termination\
Upon the termination of this Agreement for any reason, You agree to immediately cease all use of the SDK and erase and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the SDK and all copies of Apple Confidential Information in Your and Your Authorized Users' possession or control. At Apple\'92s request, You agree to provide written certification of such destruction to Apple. The provisions of Sections 1, 2.4, 2.5, 3.1(d), 3.2(c), 3.2(d), 3.2(e), 3.2(f), 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 will survive any termination of this Agreement. Apple will not be liable for compensation, indemnity, or damages of any sort as a result of terminating this Agreement in accordance with its terms, and termination of this Agreement will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy Apple may have, now or in the future.  \
\
7.      NO WARRANTY\
The SDK may contain inaccuracies or errors that could cause failures or loss of data and it may be incomplete. Apple may, through the SDK, provide or make available services (collectively the \'93Services\'94). Apple and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event will Apple be liable for the removal of or disabling of access to any such Services. Apple may also impose limits on the use of or access to certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability. YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT USE OF THE SDK AND SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SATISFACTORY QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY AND EFFORT IS WITH YOU. THE SDK AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE", WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND APPLE AND APPLE'S LICENSORS (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS "APPLE" FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 7 AND 8) HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE SDK AND SERVICES, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. APPLE DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE SDK, THAT THE SDK OR SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SDK OR SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, THAT DEFECTS IN THE SDK OR SERVICES WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THE SDK OR SERVICES WILL BE COMPATIBLE WITH FUTURE APPLE PRODUCTS OR SOFTWARE. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLE OR AN APPLE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE WILL CREATE A WARRANTY. SHOULD THE SDK OR SERVICES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. Location data provided by any Services is for basic navigational purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate or incomplete location data may lead to death, personal injury, property or environmental damage. Neither Apple nor any of its licensors guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of location data or any other data displayed by any Services.\
\
8.              LIMITATION OF LIABILITY \
TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL APPLE BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SDK OR SERVICES, OR YOUR DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS, HOWEVER CAUSED, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF APPLE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. In no event shall Apple\'92s total liability to You under this Agreement for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).\
\
9.      General Legal Terms\

Apple may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify You, to improve the SDK, our products or to provide services or technologies to You and our customers.  \
\
9.3             Assignment\
This Agreement may not be assigned, nor may any of Your obligations under this Agreement be delegated, in whole or in part, by You by operation of law, merger, or any other means without Apple\'92s express prior written consent and any attempted assignment without such consent will be null and void.\
\
9.4     Relationship of Parties  \
This Agreement will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture, fiduciary duty, or any other form of legal association between You and Apple, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or otherwise. This Agreement is not for the benefit of any third parties.\
\
9.5     Independent Development \
Nothing in this Agreement will impair Apple's right to develop, acquire, license, market, promote, or distribute products or technologies that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Your Applications or any other products or technologies that You may develop, produce, market, or distribute.\
\
9.6     Notices\

\
9.7             Severability \
If a court of competent jurisdiction finds any clause of this Agreement to be unenforceable for any reason, that clause of this Agreement shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. However, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and specifically complying with the Sections of this Agreement entitled "SDK Internal Use License and Restrictions" or "Your Obligations" or prevents the enforceability of either of those Sections, this Agreement will immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of the SDK as described in the Section entitled \'93Term and Termination.\'94\
\
9.8     Waiver and Construction  \
Failure by Apple to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any laws or regulations that provide that the language of a contract will be construed against the drafter will not apply to this Agreement. Section headings are for convenience only and are not to be considered in construing or interpreting this Agreement.\
\
